# streamlit-2nd_app

This is for a challenge for the Wild Code School named 'Streamlit partie 2 - Manipuler des graphiques'.

We are using a bunch of datasets (fint them here : https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data) for creating our second app on Streamlit.

This app should contains : 
- the possibility to choose which dataset, the user wants to use
- for displaying a graph, the choice for x-axis and y-axis, and th type of graph they want to use (scatter_chart, bar_chart, or line_chart)
- then a checkbox for displaying (or not) the correlation matrix
